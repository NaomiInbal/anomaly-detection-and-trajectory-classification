**Project Overview:**


The last branch with the updated filesis : 
This project comprises three stages:

1. **Data Anomaly Generation :**
   - File: Route_classification_anomaly_detection.ipynb
   - Description: Creation of anomalies within an existing data repository .

2. **Vehicle Track Database Creation and LSTM Modeling:**
   - Files:
     - main.py
     - tracks_database.csv
     - tracks_database_modified.csv
     - xgboost_model.py
     - creating_synthetic_track_database
   - Description: Establishment of a database housing vehicle tracks, incorporating both normal and anomalous routes. Various LSTM models are developed for analysis.

3. **Missile Trajectory Simulation:**
   - File: creating_missile_trajectories.ipynb
   - Description: Simulation of missile trajectories and generation of LSTM models. Results are stored in a folder named "missile data" within Google Drive.
   
      **Note:**
      - Running LSTM_models.ipynb automatically generates the "missile data" folder in Google Drive upon confirmation.
